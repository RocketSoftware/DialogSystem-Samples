   Overview

   be animated to improve the visual feedback of a user interface.


   Files Required

   The files needed to run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     ANIMDEMO.GS          The ANIMDEMO Dialog System screenset file.

     ANIMDEMO.TXT         This ANIMDEMO document.


   Running the Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   There is no program supplied with this demonstration. The demonstration
   can be run by invoking the definition software, by using DSRUNNER, or by
   loading the supplied Net Express project file and using the Animate, Run
   menu choice in the Net Express IDE.

   Press on each of the bitmaps on the screenset to see the bitmaps
   animated.


   Features
   --------

   This demonstration shows how it is possible to attach bitmaps to push
   buttons, and by continually refreshing the bitmap, give an animated
   impression. Please refer to the screenset dialog for further details
   of how this is done.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   When using Screenset Animator to animate ANIMDEMO.GS it is advisable
   to edit the global dialog to comment out the line "TIMEOUT 20 INC-SCROLL"
   which is part of the dialog for the SCREENSET-INITIALIZED event.

   If this line of dialog is not commented out, then Screenset Animator
   will loop executing the procedure "INC-SCROLL" indefinately, as this
   procedure is called every 1/5th of a second.
