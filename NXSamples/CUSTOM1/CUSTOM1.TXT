   CUSTOM1 Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This CUSTOM1 example program is a modified version of the CUSTOMER
   example program. It has been enhanced to show how multiple instances
   of screensets may be created.


   Files Required
   --------------

   The files needed to build and run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     CUSTOM1.GS           The CUSTOM1 Dialog System screenset.

     CUSTOM2.GS           The CUSTOM2 Dialog System screenset.

     CUSTOM1.CBL          The CUSTOM1 COBOL program.
      - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System control file.
      - dssysinf.cpy      Dialog System system information file.

     CUSTOM1.ERR          Error messages used by the demo.

     CUSTOM1.TXT          This CUSTOM1 document.

     CUSTOM1.APP          The Net Express project file.


   Compiling and Running The Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------------------------

   In order to run the CUSTOM1 demonstration, you need to compile the
   CUSTOM1.CBL demonstration program by using the Net Express Project/Rebuild All
   menu choice.

   To run the program having created the .INT file as detailed above,
   run or animate the program CUSTOM1.INT using the Net Express Animate menu or
   the relevant toolbar button.


   Features
   --------

   This demonstration shows how you can create and manage multiple instances of 
   the same screenset. It is an adapted version of the Customer Screenset, with
   the required multiple instance functionality removed into a seperate screenset.

   The CUSTOM1 screenset contains the Customer Details window and the Order
   Entry dialog box, and the CUSTOM2 screenset contains the Change Order dialog 
   box from the CUSTOMER screenset.



   Extra Notes
   -----------

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
