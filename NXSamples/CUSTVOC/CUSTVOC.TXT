                             Dialog System V3.0

                       CUSTVOC Demonstration Program

   *********************************************************************


   CUSTVOC Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This CUSTVOC example shows how you can embed Dialog System functions
   within a COBOL program.

   CUSTVOC is a re-working of the CUSTOMER Dialog System demo.


   Files Required
   --------------

   The files needed to build and run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     CUSTVOC.GS           The CUSTVOC Dialog System screenset.

     CUSTVOC.CBL          The main CUSTVOC COBOL program.
      - custvoc.cpy       The screenset Vocabulary copybook
      - custvoc.cpb       The screenset data block copybook
      - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System control file.
      - dslang.cpy        Copy file to add dialog syntax to the COBOL
                          language.

     VOCCLR.CBL           CALLOUT COBOL programs containing dialog script.
     VOCDEL.CBL
     VOCDELI.CBL
     VOCESC.CBL
     VOCLOAD.CBL
     VOCOK.CBL
     VOCORD.CBL
     VOCPROC.CBL
     VOCSAVE.CBL
      - ds-call.cpy       Dialog System CALLOUT interface COPY file (used
                          by all of these programs).
      - dslang.cpy        Copy file to add dialog syntax to the COBOL
                          language (used by all of these programs).

     VOCCOMP.BAT          DOS batch file to compile the CUSTVOC programs.

     CUSTVOC.TXT          This CUSTVOC document
     CUSTVOC.APP          The CUSTVOC Net Express project file


   Compiling and Running The Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------------------------

   In order to run the CUSTVOC demonstration, you need to compile the
   COBOL program supplied with the demonstration.

   Select the Rebuild option from Project on the main menu to compile
   all of the programs in the project to INT code.

   To run the program having created the .INT files as detailed above,
   run or animate the program CUSTVOC.INT.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   The majority of the Dialog functons that used to be embedded in the
   screenset can now be found in the several sub-programs that make up
   CUSTVOC. Where the screenset in the CUSTOMER demo would execute the
   functions in the screenset, CUSTVOC instead uses CALLOUT to execute a
   particular COBOL entry point where the functions can be found instead.

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
