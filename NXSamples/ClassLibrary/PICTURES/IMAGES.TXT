                                Dialog System V3

                    Using Windows Image formats Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The IMAGE screenset is provided as an example of how to use a
   control program to add any Windows Picture object files to your Dialog
   System application.


   Files required
   --------------

   The files needed to run the demonstration program are:

        Name of the file     Description of the file
        ----------------     -----------------------
        IMAGE.GS             The demonstration screenset
        IMAGE.CBL            The application program
         - image.cpb         Screenset datablock copyfile
         - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System Control Block copyfile

        IMAGECTL.CBL         Image management control program
         - image.cpb         Screenset datablock copyfile
         - strcture.cpy      Control Program interface copyfile
         - p2cevent.cpy      Class library event code identifier copyfile
         - ds-call.cpy       Screenset CALLOUT Control block
         - userctrl.cpy      Dialog System runtime/Control program interface
                             definition

        DSWINDOW.CBL         Class program which sub-classes the application
                             window to enable the images to be painted.

        IMAGES.APP           The Net Express project file

        IMAGES.TXT           This document.


   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied IMAGES.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the User
   control object defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in
   the controls associated program. This program forces the sub-classing of the
   application window so that the DSWINDOW class can paint the picture object
   on the newly created window.


   Run the built application. The main window appears and the image is
   displayed.  Select the Browse push button to select any other valid Windows
   Picture object file type.



   Adding a User Control to your application
   =========================================

   This demonstration was created using the programmable User control that you
   you can paint on your application window, by selecting the User Control
   object on the Objects tab of the Dialog System toolbar palette.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create a skeleton - non functional - control program in your project.

   Tailor the control program to provide the functionality you require, as has
   been done with this demonstration.


   Screenset Data import
   ---------------------

   If you have not used the New GUI Application Wizard to create the control
   program, you will need to import the following files contained in the
   DialogSystem\Source directory:

       FUNCDATA.IMP    The generic communication area used by all control
                       programs
