               Date and Time Picker controls demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   This demonstration illustrates how to use the Date and Time Picker common
   controls with Dalog System applications.

        DATETIME.APP         The Net Express project file

        DATETIME.TXT         This document.


   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied DATETIME.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the object
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the control on the newly created
   window.

   The demonstration shows how to set and retrieve data from the drop-down list
   date and time picker controls. It includes full details on configuring the
   control and manipulating it at runtime.

   The manipulation functions cover most of the functionality provided by the
   control.

   Run the built application. The resulting window shows both the date and time
   picker controls, and pushbuttons which illustrate the use of the control to
   populate data block master fields.

   These manipulation functions are well documented in the dialog and COBOL
   code and additional documentation is available for the date and time picker
   classes via the Net Express help.


   Adding a Control to your application
   =========================================

   This demonstration was created using the programmable date and time picker
   controls that you can paint on your application window, by selecting
   the Programmed controls tab of the Dialog System toolbar palette.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create the control program in your project.

   You need to place calls in your application to get or set the date or
   time information as illustrated in this demonstration.
