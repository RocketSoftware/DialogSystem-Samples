                              Dialog System V3

                     Progress Bar Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The PRGDEMO screenset is provided as an example of how to use a
   control program to add a Progress Bar control to your Dialog System
   application.

   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied PROGRESS.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the object
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the control on the newly created
   window.

   Run the built application. The main window appears containing two entry
   fields which, for this demonstration will simulate the start and end
   positions (for instance the number of records to read) of the processing loop
   that your application enters.

   Accept the defaults and press the Processing Loop pushbutton.

   This pushbutton places focus onto a 'Processing...' dialog, and the
   WINDOW-CREATED event calls out to the control program to initialize with the
   object handle of any CANCEL pushbutton required, as well as the expected
   end position (100% complete) of the loop.

   As with a typical application, a RETC then returns to the calling program,
   which enters a processing loop (data access etc) and in that loop, "STEP"
   function calls are made to the control program to advise the current
   progress position.

   You will note the use of the runUntilEmpty method in this STEP call, which
   allows the CANCEL button events to be processed when they occur, to allow
   processing to be interrupted.

   These manipulation functions are well documented in the dialog and COBOL
   code and additional documentation is available for the List View class
   via the Net Express help.


   Adding a List Control to your application
   =========================================

   This demonstration was created using the programmable Progress bar
   control that you can paint on your application window, by selecting
   the Programmed controls tab of the Dialog System toolbar palette.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create the control program in your project.

   You need to place the INITIALIZE call in your application to establish
   the CANCEL button and initial maximum range, as illustrated in this
   demonstration. You also need to modify the generated code in the "TO DO"
   comment sections of the generated program. These modifications are detailed
   below.

   Screenset Data import
   ---------------------

   If you have not used the New GUI Application Wizard to create the control
   program, you will need to import the following files contained in the
   DialogSystem\Source directory:

       FUNCDATA.IMP    The generic communication area used by all control
                       programs


   Modifications required
   ----------------------

   The generated program has comments containing "TO DO" items, and you need to
   modify the program to enable each Progress bar you use, to be correctly
   configured to meet your requirements.

   These simple modifications are well documented in the source code - search
   for "TO DO" - and are as follows:

       -   Estabish the Datablock Master field to be used when the processing is
           interrupted by any CANCEL pushbutton. This is then examined during
           the application processing loop to determine when to interrupt
           processing.
