                              Dialog System V3

                       Rich Edit Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The RICHED screenset is provided as an example of how to use a
   control program to add a Rich Edit control to your Dialog System application.


   Files required
   --------------

   The files needed to run the demonstration program are:

        Name of the file     Description of the file

        RICHEDIT.APP         The Net Express project file

        RICHEDIT.TXT         This document.


   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied RICHEDIT.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the object
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the control on the newly created
   window.

   The demonstration creates a Rich Edit Control containing no initial text.

   The demonstration illustrates how the control is interacted with and includes
   full details on configuring the control and manipulating it at runtime.

   The manipulation functions cover most of the functionality provided by the
   control, in a procedural programming context that Dialog System programmers
   will be familiar with.

   Run the built application. The main window appears and the rich edit
   control is shown with focus.

   The manipulation functions are well documented in the COBOL code and additional
   documentation is available for the rich edit class via the Net Express help.


   Adding a Rich Edit Control to your application
   ==============================================

   This demonstration was created using the programmable Rich Edit
   control that you can paint on your application window, by selecting
   the Programmed controls tab of the Dialog System toolbar palette.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create the control program in your project.


   Screenset Data import
   ---------------------

   If you have not used the New GUI Application Wizard to create the control
   program, you will need to import the following files contained in the
   DialogSystem\Source directory:

       FUNCDATA.IMP    The generic communication area used by all control
                       programs
