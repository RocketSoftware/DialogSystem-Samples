                              Dialog System V3

                        Slider Control Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The SLDDEMO screenset is provided as an example of how to use a
   control program to add a Slider control to your Dialog System application.


   Files required

   The files needed to run the demonstration program are:

        Name of the file     Description of the file

        SLIDER.APP           The Net Express project file

        SLIDER.TXT           This document.


   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied SLIDER.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the object
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the control on the newly created
   window.

   The demonstration creates a Slider Control, setting the default Min/Max
   range, and shows how this is changed. The demonstration illustrates how
   the control is interacted with and includes full details on configuring
   the control and manipulating it at runtime.

   The manipulation functions cover most of the functionality provided by the
   control, in a context that Dialog System programmers will be familiar with
   based on use of the Scroll Bar object.

   Run the built application. The main window appears and the slider control is
   set at the zero position.

   The range and position manipulation functions are well documented in the
   COBOL code and additional documentation is available for the slider class
   via the Net Express help.


   Adding a Slider Control to your application
   ===========================================

   This demonstration was created using the programmable Slider
   control that you can paint on your application window, by selecting
   the Programmed controls tab of the Dialog System toolbar palette.

   When the control is painted, the Control properties dialog appears, select
   the "Add program to current project" check box and the "Generate" push button
   to create the control program in your project.

   A single program can maintain multiple Slider Controls. You need to modify
   the generated code in the "TO DO" comment sections of the generated program
   These modifications are detailed below.

   Screenset Data import
   ---------------------

   If you have not used the New GUI Application Wizard to create the control
   program, you will need to import the following files contained in the
   DialogSystem\Source directory:

       FUNCDATA.IMP    The generic communication area used by all control
                       programs

   Modifications required
   ----------------------

   The generated program has comments containing "TO DO" items, and you need to
   modify the program to enable each Slider control you use, to be correctly
   configured to meet your requirements.

   These simple modifications are well documented in the source code - search
   for "TO DO" - and are as follows:


       -   On creation of the control, modify the properties of the control to
           include the range and tick frequency settings you requre.
