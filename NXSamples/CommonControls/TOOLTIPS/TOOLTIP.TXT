   The files needed to run the demonstration program are:

        Name of the file     Description of the file
        ----------------     -----------------------
        TTIPDEMO.GS          The demonstration screenset
        TTIPDEMO.CBL         The application program
         - ttipdemo.cpb      Screenset datablock copyfile
         - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System Control Block copyfile

        TOOLTIP.APP          The Net Express project file

        TOOLTIP.TXT          This document.


   Running The Demonstration Program

   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   The demonstration comprises a normal application control program
   which calls DSGRUN, and a screenset.

   TTIPDEMO.GS contains dialog on the WINDOW-CREATED event to execute the
   SETUP-TIP dialog procedure for each object where a tip is to be displayed.
   This procedure uses the dialog INVOKE function to execute the relevant class
   library methods to establish a tip for each object.

   Similar code could be added to a User Control program which performs the same
   functions based on a list of controls you require tooltips for.

   The dialog code is commented to identify what is happening. In summary, the
   code detemines the GUI class library object for the supplied handle. It
   creates a tooltip and a character array instance for the required text and
   adds the gadget and text to the  tooltip instance. This completes the task
   and the window objects will have the tooltip enabled until the window
   is deleted.

   See the Class library documentation for additional methods avaialable to
   the tooltip class.
