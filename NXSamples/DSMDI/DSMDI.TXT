   Overview

   MDI frame will be MDI children, and may be used for Tile/Cascade/Arrange Icons 
   functionality.

   Features
   --------
   This screenset shows how its is possible to use the MDI window interface with 
   Dialog System screensets. It also illustrates the child window arrangement 
   functions and the ability to restrict the area of the MDI Frame window. 

   This enables window sections to be excluded from any of the arrangement functions. 
   This would be required for instance if your window contained a toolbar area, which 
   was not to be overlaid by the arrangement of the MDI Children.

   For full details on how these functions are implemented, please refer to the 
   screenset dialog, and the comments contained.
