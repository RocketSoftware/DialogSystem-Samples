                              Dialog System V3.0

                  Object Configuration Demonstration program

   *********************************************************************


   DSOBJCFG Demonstration Program 
   ------------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This example shows how you can alter the properties of Dialog System
   objects at runtime using a simple CALLOUT to the supplied Dialog System 
   extension program DSOBJCFG.

   The demonstration illustrates how this may be achieved when the object is
   either created and shown to the user, or before the objects creation.

   Files Required
   --------------

   There is no program supplied with this demonstration.

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     DSOBJCFG.GS        The Dialog System screenset.
     STYLDATA.GNT	This program will create a data group of possible
			STYLE values appropriate to the supplied control type.
			(See details below.)

   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------


   Run the screenset by selecting the Net Express Animate, Run menu choice or by
   loading it into the definition software, and selecting the File, Run
   option from the menu bar.


   Features
   --------

   This demonstration screenset shows how it is possible to dynamically alter the 
   appearance of controls in your Dialog System screenset using one simple CALLOUT.

   When running the demonstration, Select an Item from each of the three selection
   boxes, and press the Change push button. A new window is shown and requested
   changes will be applied to the control type you selected. 

   Note that when selecting SIZE and POSN change items,  the DSOBJCFG program input 
   parameter values are created by coded Dialog. When using the STYLE and TYPE change 
   you are required to input 1 or 2 parameters as required - as detailed in the 
   reference documentation.

   e.g. Changing a STYLE - Select the required Object, STYL, and the appropriate Change 
   Mode from the three selection boxes. Select the required STYLE from the displayed 
   list of Styles that may be changed, select On/Off (1/0) and press the Change push button.

   e.g. Changing a TYPE - Select the required Object, TYPE, and the appropriate Change 
   Mode from the three selection boxes. Enter the required TYPE value that may be changed 
   as documented in the reference material, select any second parameter input value 
   (if needed) and press the Change push button.

   Note that in this demonstration if you select any option other than the 
   "Screenset DATA only" from the Change mode selection box, the Window is created 
   before any changes are applied. Changing the "Screenset DATA only" option will
   modify the screenset data before creation of the window.
 

   These features are enabled by a CALLOUT to the runtime object configuration module 
   DSOBJCFG, please see screenset dialog, and the DS Reference maual for full details
   on implementation of this feature.

   Limitations
   -----------

   Not all properties are configurable after the controls creation. Please refer to the 
   supplied reference and the PanelsV2 on-line reference for information on control 
   attributes that may be changed after the controls creation.




   The STYLDATA Program
   --------------------

   This program is supplied as a mechanism of obtaining a data group containing STYLE 
   details that may be changed via the CALLOUT to DSOBJCFG. You supply this program
   with an Object type and a data group as follows:

	STYLE-OBJECT-TYPE                C5     1.0           
	STYLE-GROUP                      22              
	  STYLE-NAME                     X     20.0           
	  STYLE-VALUE                    C5     4.0           
   
   On Entry:

   STYLE-OBJECT-TYPE	Set this to one of the Object types as identified in
			the DSOBJCFG documentation

   On Exit:			
			The data group has been established with the available
			STYLE details which may be changed for this object

   This program is supplied for use with the DSOBJCFG demonstration screenset. It provides 
   information used by the demonstration, but may be used freely with your applications. In 
   practice however, once you are aware of the values to be changed you may prefer to set the
   required values yourself in your calling COBOL program, so are unlikely to need this program 
   in your application
