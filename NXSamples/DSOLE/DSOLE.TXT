   DSOLE Dialog System Extension Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   The DSOLE Dialog System Extension provides extensions to the OLE 2.0
   functionality provided directly within Dialog System. It includes
   functionality to load and save objects, edit styles and allow
   objects to be activated in-place.

   See the DSOLE topic in your help for full information.

   Files Required

   There is no program supplied with this demonstration.

   The files needed to run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file

     DSOLE.GS             The DSOLE Dialog System screenset

     DSOLE.GNT            The DSOLE Dialog System Extension module.

     DSOLE.TXT            The Net Express DSOLE project.
     DSOLE.TXT            This DSOLE document.


   Running the Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Run the screenset by selecting the Animate, Run menu choice on the Net Express
   IDE or by loading it into the definition software, and selecting the File,
   Run option from the menu bar.


   Demonstration Features
   ----------------------

   This demonstration screenset illustrates the use of the DSOLE Dialog System 
   Extension(DSX), together with the OLE control and OLE-UPDATED events to maintain 
   and use OLE objects in your Dialog System application.

   The DSOLE DSX is used for maintenance of the OLE object and includes functionality
   to maintain Embedded and Linked objects, via modification of the OLE site and 
   container window. 

   Access to certain OLE common dialogs (Insert object/Edit Links etc) is also provided 
   by this DSX.


   Using the demonstration
   -----------------------

   The DSOLE screenset has a Bitmap embedded as an OLE object. You may substitute this
   object for any OLE2.0 compliant object such as a Microsoft Excel worksheet or Word
   document. Select the Delete object push button, followed by the Insert Object push
   button to implement this. Please see the 'Using DSOLE' topic in the help for a discussion
   on Embedded and Linked objects.

   The window is shown with the current container and OLE control site styles, set as
   indicated by the displayed radio buttons and check boxes. You may modify any of 
   these settings to achieve the behavior you require, by selection of the relevant 
   control and selecting the Apply styles push button. Please see screenset dialog 
   and the 'DSOLE Functions' topic in the help for full details.

   Embedded objects can be made to retain any changes when their Persistent property
   is set via the Dialog System definition software - Functions for the Load and save 
   of persistency data are also demonstrated in this screenset.

   You may manipulate embedded or linked objects via the DSOLE - DO VERB 
   functionality (DOVB). This provides you with a mechanism to execute functions 
   provided by OLE 2.0, on the objects you are working with. The available functions
   are listed in the DoVerb selection box on the demonstration window. Note that 
   support for these functions is provided by your object itself, so not all may be 
   available for objects you are working with.

   Once you have executed an OLE2.0  verb on the object you are dealing with, 
   OLE-UPDATED events are received by the Dialog System screenset and the nature of
   these events are displayed in a list box on the demonstration window.
