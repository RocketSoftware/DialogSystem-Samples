                      DSP2DEMO Demonstration Program

   DSP2DEMO Demonstration Program
   ------------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This DSP2DEMO example shows several examples of how to use Panels
   Version 2 to enhance Dialog System screensets. See the Features
   section later for further details.


   Files Required
   --------------

   The files needed to build and run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     DSP2DEMO.GS          The DSP2DEMO Dialog System screenset
      - ds-cntrl.mf       Dialog System control file
      - dssysinf.cpy      Dialog System system information file

     DSP2DEMO.CBL         The DSP2DEMO COBOL program

     DSP2DEMO.TXT         This DSP2DEMO document


   Compiling and Running The Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------------------------

   In order to run the DSP2DEMO demonstration, you need to compile the
   DSP2DEMO.CBL demonstration program.

   Compile the DSP2DEMO.CBL program to .INT format using the Net Express
   Project, Rebuild All menu choice.

   To run the program having created the .INT file as detailed above,
   run or animate the program usin the Net Express Animate menu or toolbar
   buttons.


   Features
   --------

   There are 3 featured examples:

   1. Using Panels Version 2 to color an object. Although this is made
      redundant by the SET-COLOR function, and color selection at
      definition time, it shows how simple it is to modify screen
      objects with a single PANELS2 call.

   2. Using Panels Version 2 to access the clipboard

   3. Handling Panels Version 2 events back in your application program.
      This particular example shows how to scroll a window (again this is
      redundant with scrollable windows in Dialog System), but it shows
      the techniques required.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   Please note that to avoid over-complicating the demonstration, not
   all scroll bar events are handled by this program. In particular,
   the dragging of the slider thumb is not supported.

   In order to close the events window, you should press the 'Cancel'
   push button. When the events demonstration window appears, this button
   is not visible. You must scroll the window down and right in order to
   see the button. The remainder of the gadgets on the window have no
   actions associated with them. You can also close the window using the
   system menu.

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
