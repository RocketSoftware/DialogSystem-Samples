   DSRNR Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This DSRNR example is an example of a screenset that uses DSRUNNER.

   The DSRUNNER screenset is an example of a 'main' screenset that can
   be used to start other DSRUNNER screensets. You are free to use and
   modify the screenset in any way to package with your application.

   The DSRNR screenset is started by the DSRUNNER example screenset.
   It shows how to write a sub-program that is called by DSRUNNER, and
   includes initialization, termination, error handling and so on.


   Files Required
   --------------

   There is no main program supplied with this demonstration. The
   demonstration is designed to be run using DSRUNNER.

   The files needed to build and run the demonstration program are:

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     DSRNR.GS             The DSRNR Dialog System screenset.

     DSRUNNER.GS          DSRUNNER screenset.

     DSRNR.CBL            The DSRNR COBOL program.
      - dsrunner.cpy      DSRUNNER information COPY file.
      - dssysinf.cpy      Dialog System system information file.

     DSRUNNER.GNT         The DSRUNNER main program.

     DSRNR.APP            The Net Express project file supplied with the demo.

     DSRNR.CPB            The Dialog System data block copyfile for DSRNR.GS.

     DSRNR.TXT            This DSRNR document.


   Compiling and Running The Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------------------------

   In order to run the DSRNR demonstration, you need to compile the
   DSRNR.CBL demonstration program.

   Load the supplied Net Express project file and select Rebuild All
   from the Project menu.

   Run the demonstration by selecting Run from the Animate menu.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
