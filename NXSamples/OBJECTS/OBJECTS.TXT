                       OBJECTS Demonstration Program

   OBJECTS Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This OBJECTS example shows an example of most of the objects that
   may be created using Dialog System.

   OLE controls are not covered by this demonstration. See the DSOLE
   demonstration for an example of an OLE control.

   User controls are not covered by this demonstration. See the OCXDS,
   SBARDS, SPINDS, TREEDS, and TBARDS demonstrations for examples of
   user controls.

   Compiling and Running The Demonstration Program
   -----------------------------------------------

   In order to run the OBJECTS demonstration, you need to compile the
   OBJECTS.CBL demonstration program.

   Load the supplied Net Express project file and select Rebuild All
   from the Project menu.

   Run the demonstration by selecting Run from the Animate menu.


   Features
   --------

   The demo program displays each of the objects that can be defined to
   make up and design a Dialog System screenset.


   Extra Notes
   -----------

   When you compile a program from within the Net Express IDE, the
   INT and IDY files may (depending on your project's build type) be
   placed in a directory below your working directory. When running the
   demonstration outside of the IDE you must make sure the project build
   directory is on your COBDIR.
