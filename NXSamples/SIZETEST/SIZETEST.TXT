                       SIZETEST Demonstration program

   SIZETEST Demonstration Program 
   ------------------------------


   Overview
   --------

   This SIZETEST example shows how you can create Dialog System windows and their
   gadgets which at runtime are resized appropriate to the current resolution.

   The demonstration also illustrates how, by dragging a windows size border, all
   child windows and gadgets of the resized window will be repositioned and resized
   in relation to the change in size and position of the parent window.

   Files Required
   --------------

   There is no program supplied with this demonstration. The demonstration
   can be run by invoking the definition software, or by using DSRUNNER.

   Name of the file     Description of the file
   ----------------     -----------------------------------------------------
     SIZETEST.GS        The Dialog System screenset.
     SIZETEST.DFT       The font side file text format
     SIZETEST.DFB       The font side file binary format

     SIZETEST.TXT       This document

     SIZETEST.APP       The Net Express project file supplied with the demo.


   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied Net Express project file and run the demonstration
   by selecting Run from the Animate menu.


   Features
   --------

   This demonstration shows how you can build Client/Server applications for 
   deployment on multiple hardware platforms and resolutions, using a single sourced
   Dialog System screenset.
   
   The supplied font side file contains three font records which at runtime redefine 
   the font style used in the screenset. When running this screenset at resolutions
   other than 1024*768 you should previously set the environment variables as follows:

   When running at:

   640*480
   SET DSFNTENV=CONFIG1

   800*600
   SET DSFNTENV=CONFIG2

   1024*769
   (No variable required)

   You may change the font side file information as required, please refer to the 
   DS Reference manual Appendix B for full information.

   This will load the appropriate font for the resolution at runtime.

   Additionally, when resizing the parent window by dragging its size border you will
   notice that all child windows and gadgets are resized and positioned appropriate to
   the change in the parent window. To disable this feature, you may require to remove
   the size border, by setting the feature off in the Window Properties dialog box.

   Both these features are enabled by a CALLOUT to the runtime configuration module 
   DSRTCFG, please see screenset dialog, and the DS Reference maual for full details
   on implementation of this feature.

   Limitations
   -----------

   Note that resizing a Window by dragging its size border will not automatically 
   adjust the font sizes used by your controls. This may be implemented in a future
   update of Dialog System, but you are able to mitigate the effects of this possibility
   through a well laid out window design.
