                              Dialog System V3.0

                        Splitter window Demonstration

   *********************************************************************



   Overview
   --------

   The SPITTER screenset is provided as an example of how to use a Dialog
   System window as a frame to contain child windows or objects, which react
   in a synchronized manner to window resizing, or dragging of the vertical
   splitter bar that divides the window frame client area.

   When used with TreeView and ListView controls, this implementation gives a
   true emulation of the Windows Explorer style user interface for your
   application.

        LVICONS.DLL          Resource DLL containing icon images used
                             NOTE: The icons are provided in the LVIEW
                             demonstration directory. That project also
                             illustrates how to build the DLL used in this
                             demonstration.

        INVENTORY.DAT        The data file used for the demonstration

        SPLIT.APP            The Net Express project file

        SPLIT.TXT            This document.


   Running The Demonstration Program
   ---------------------------------

   Load the supplied SPLIT.APP file into your Net Express IDE and
   select the Project/Rebuild All menu choice.


   Features
   --------

   At window creation time, the Dialog System runtime encounters the objects
   defined on the window, and calls the "create" entry point in the controls
   associated program. This program places the controls on the newly created
   window.

   Following creation, screenset dialog makes a CALLOUT to the cParent program,
   which modifies the frame window to be an object of the splitwindow class. The
   initial split position is provided to the object instance, derived from the X
   (indent from left) position of the rightmost (List View) control.

   The splitter window is now active and the Windows Explorer style application
   runs.

   This demonstration populates a Tree Control from a sequential data file, and
   shows how Tree item selection causes the population of the accompanying List
   control with data from the selected Tree data category.

   Note that Dialog System Dynamic resizing functionality is NOT enabled in this
   application, but it is possible to size the main frame window, and move the
   vertical splitter bar, and the controls automatically resize to fill their
   parents' client area. You should not use the Dynamic Resizing functionality
   with splitter windows, as the results will be undefined.

   This is just one demonstration of how these controls are used in a split
   window context. See also the TVIEW and LVIEW demonstrations for more details
   on specific control functions.
